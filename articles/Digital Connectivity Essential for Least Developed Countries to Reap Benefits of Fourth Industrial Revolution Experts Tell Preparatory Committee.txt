Digital Connectivity Essential for Least Developed Countries to Reap Benefits of Fourth Industrial Revolution Experts Tell Preparatory Committee Digital connectivity and access to modern technologies are essential for least developed countries to reap the benefits of the fourth industrial revolution and build resilient economies after the ravages of the COVID19 pandemic speakers and panellists told the Preparatory Committee for the fifth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries today Sajeeb Wazed Information and Communication Technology Affairs Adviser to the Prime Minister of Bangladesh cited a major national 13year initiative that has transformed the country into a digital leader among developing nations  Since founding Digital Bangladesh in 2008 Bangladesh has boomed from 3 per cent of its people online to 70 per cent or 116 million people He noted the significant economic payoff with gross domestic product GDP growth in Bangladesh outpacing India Pakistan and even China rising by 6 per cent during the pandemic when whole of South Asia decreased by 6 per cent However it is a myth that competition alone can solve broadband issues he stressed as countries must invest in information technologies the way they do in roads fostering publicprivate partnerships to lay down infrastructure reduce costs and spur innovation  Bangladesh is willing to share expertise in developing that technology at low cost using their own innovation At the Doha conference Heads of State and Government will formulate a successor framework to the Istanbul Programme of Action adopted in 2011  The intergovernmental Preparatory Committee will meet twice beforehand from 24 to 28 May and from 26 to 30 July to agree on elements of the new 10year framework  An organizational session of the Committee was held on 8 February to elect its two CoChairs Despite the Bangladesh success story speakers emphasized that too many people in least developed countries still lack access to digital technologies and services that have become essential in the age of COVID19  They recalled the target set by the Istanbul Programme of Action calling for universal and affordable access to the Internet by 2020 pointing out that in 2019 almost 87 per cent of people in developed countries used the Internet compared with only 19 per cent in the worlds poorest a divide exacerbated by the pandemic And costs remain prohibitive reminded Moshe Kao Programme Management Officer for the United Nations Technology Bank for Least Developed Countries  Achieving universal affordable and quality Internet access by 2030 across Africa may cost as much as 100 billion  Reaching 36 billion currently unconnected people worldwide will cost much more  Scientific academies should not be a gentlemans club of white coats he stressed noting that less than 1 per cent of scientific articles emerge from least developed countries That sentiment was echoed by Thelma Quaye Head of Digital Infrastructure and Capacity Building of the Smart Africa Secretariat who called for broadband to be an essential service like water and electricity  Information and communications technology must be mainstreamed in education or we are preparing our children for failure in the next 10 years she said Technology is not a silver bullet said Shahid Yusuf Chief Economist of The Growth Dialogue at the George Washington University School of Business in Washington DC and Adjunct Professor at Johns Hopkins Universitys School of Advanced International Studies  However it can substantially reinforce the growth impetus that sound policies deliver The other morning speakers featured were Perks Master Clemency Ligoya Malawi CoChair of the Committee keynote speaker Houlin Zhao SecretaryGeneral of the International Telecommunication Union ITU and representatives of the World Food Programme WFP and the World Intellectual Property Organization WIPO The representatives of Bangladesh and Turkey also spoke In the afternoon the Preparatory Committee held its third panel discussion under the theme Structural transformation as a driver of prosperity The Preparatory Committee will reconvene at 10 am on Thursday 27 May continuing its first session with two virtual panel discussions Panel 2 In the morning the Preparatory Committee held the second of its panel discussions on the theme of Leveraging the power of science technology and innovation to fight multidimensional vulnerabilities and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals cochaired by Marie Chatardová Czech Republic and Perks Master Clemency Ligoya Malawi and featuring keynote speakers Sajeeb Wazed Information and Communication Technology Affairs Adviser to the Prime Minister of Bangladesh and Houlin Zhao SecretaryGeneral of the International Telecommunication Union ITU It also featured panellists Thelma Quaye Head of Digital Infrastructure and Capacity Building of the Smart Africa Secretariat Shahid Yusuf Chief Economist of The Growth Dialogue at the George Washington University School of Business in Washington DC and Adjunct Professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies and Moshe Kao Programme Management Officer for the United Nations Technology Bank for Least Developed Countries Introducing the speakers Ms CHATARDOVÁ highlighted the need to overcome structural constraints on education electricity and broadband connectivity with investment in human capital  Least developed countries need access to modern technologies to reap benefits of the fourth industrial revolution she said promoting private sector engagement in the process Mr WAZED cited his country Bangladesh as a perfect example of how to propel connectivity  Since founding Digital Bangladesh in 2008 gross domestic product GDP growth in the country has outpaced that of India Pakistan and even China growing by 6 per cent during the pandemic when the whole of South Asia decreased by 6 per cent  Switching to digital governance during the crisis providing digital health information via mobile phones he said Bangladesh has one of the worlds lowest COVID19 rates with 12000 fatalities in the eighth largest global population  Twelve years ago the country had one of most expensive broadband networks yet only 3 per cent of its people were online that number is now 70 per cent or 116 million It is a myth that competition alone can solve broadband issues he said as countries must invest in information technologies the way they do in roads  Bangladesh fostered a publicprivate partnership laying fibreoptic cable down to the village level with 90 per cent of its territory now covered in 4G connection and satellites reaching remote islands that cable cannot access  The Government has invested several billion dollars which has paid off in utility and economic growth with initiatives including training village entrepreneurs  5000 of them women  and mobile payments during the pandemic as part of the social safety net  Corruption in the social service sector has been virtually eliminated at local level while the Government has trained 2 million people in information technology skills transforming Bangladesh from a digitally backwards country he said  Bangladesh has expertise in developing technology at low cost using their own innovation he added and is happy to share it throughout developing world Mr ZHAO emphasized that too many people in least developed countries still lack access to the digital technologies and services that have become essential in the age of COVID19  this despite the target set by the Istanbul Programme of Action calling for universal and affordable access to the Internet by 2020  Addressing that challenge ITU is building a network of partners undertaking host of projects from infrastructure development to capacitybuilding  He cited the partnership with the United Nations Childrens Fund UNICEF to connect every school to Internet by 2030 involving Governments and benefitting countries in Africa the Arab region Asia and the Pacific and the Americas  ITU is also working with the International Labour Organization ILO to enhance digital skills for youth and with Australia on broadband connectivity for Pacific small island developing States  All these projects contribute to both the Istanbul Programme of Action and to the Programme of Action to be adopted at the Doha conference he said stressing the importance of connectivity Ms QUAYE said her group aims to transform Africa into a single digital market and is active in 31 countries thus far  It is increasingly obvious that digitalization must be at the centre of development  She noted the irony that the pandemic was an advocate for that transformation given the needs it revealed in education health and financial services  However she noted the situation in the global South is not as dire as it seems given the example of Bangladesh  While Africa has not adopted the latest technologies it has found a niche in innovation as mobile technology works best for us with more than 60 per cent of the population in rural areas  Broadband must be an essential service she said like water and electricity noting a usage gap as 46 per cent of Africas population has coverage but cannot afford to use it  Information and communication technology must be mainstreamed in education otherwise we are preparing our children for failure in the next 10 years Mr YUSUF said technology has amply demonstrated its importance through history from the steam engine electric power and the internal combustion engine to computerization the Internet and digital technologies each innovation improving growth potential and human welfare  For least developed countries the promise of technology lies in precision agriculture and selective automation of certain manufacturing tasks to raise productivity and export competitiveness  Digital technologies also enable retail financial business and engineering services to displace manufacturing as the leading activities  The pandemic has further highlighted the contribution of digital and biogenetic technologies to build human capital  He noted that business thrives in a stable open environment where the likelihood of unpredictable policy shifts is low and the State removes infrastructure constraints  Technology is not a silver bullet he said but it can substantially reinforce the growth impetus that sound policies can deliver Mr KAO recalled that the Istanbul Programme of Action had set a target of at least half of least developed countries qualifying for graduation but only three have managed it while seven others have met the criteria for 2026  He cited the tremendous technological challenge posed by COVID19  in 2019 close to 87 per cent of people in developed countries used the Internet compared with only 19 per cent in least developed nations  and the pandemic has exacerbated that divide  Less than 1 per cent of scientific articles emerge from those countries despite accounting for 15 per cent of the global population  Achieving universal affordable and quality Internet access by 2030 across Africa may cost as much as 100 billion he stressed and reaching 36 billion currently unconnected people worldwide will cost much more  Least developed countries must develop hard and soft infrastructure  Broadband should be an essential service and scientific academies should not be a gentlemans club of white coats he said The representative of  Bangladesh  said longterm political vision is important in delivering technological change on the ground  Least developed countries lack skills and infrastructure meaning the LDC5 outcome document must establish ambitious goals  As women have less access to digital technologies she asked the panel how that can change  She further asked how the United Nations can include the private sector The representative of  Turkey  also asked how Members States can support the United Nations Technology Bank and forge partnerships with private sector The representative of the  World Food Programme  WFP said hunger is on the rise worldwide with the number of food insecure people having doubled to 270 million during the pandemic  The responses rely on technology on all levels  Drawing attention to tools such as the Hunger Map and the deployment of drones in Mozambique after Cyclone Idai he said we need to get out of the lab and the white coats to address a crosspillar approach The representative of the  World Intellectual Property Organization  WIPO said the world not only needs technological solutions for the pandemic but food security health care access to information and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals  He expressed a vision of a world where innovation anywhere is supported by intellectual property everywhere  Some key WIPO initiatives have included free access to highend resources and transfer of technology to least developed countries  Innovation is increasingly recognized as essential for a sustainable future he said as most of the Goals rely on it so the international community must assist least developed countries in innovation catchup Mr WAZED said information technology infrastructure is expensive not just for connectivity but usage and devices which is why Bangladeshs efforts are focused on the publicprivate partnership model  He described the 100 billion cost to connect Africa as a chickenandegg problem as if there are not enough rural users private technology companies do not want to build infrastructure  Bangladesh connected Government offices and digital centres in a revenuesharing model he explained and once basic infrastructure like fibreoptic cable was in place mobile companies could provide faster service  The country now has local smartphone brands available for under 50 he said noting that the Government lays fibreoptics along electricity and railway lines to greatly reduce costs and both uses and customizes opensource software Ms QUAYE echoed calls for publicprivate partnerships citing the statistic that only 1 per cent of research comes from least developed countries  Her group is working to increase that share she said noting that the Smart Africa Secretariat has an open door to future collaboration with any of the panellists organizations Mr YUSUF said that much hope rides on digitalization but while the technologies mentioned have been available in developing economies  in some cases for decades  productivity growth has actually been declining  Until it can be enhanced by entrepreneurs through innovation we will not see the full benefits Mr KAO noted the synergies emerging from speakers interventions also underscoring the importance of the private sector because they are the ones holding the technologies  The World Trade Organization WTO TradeRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement could be a gamechanger he said  Responding to Turkeys delegate he said Member States support the Technology Bank as we are a facilitator  The Bank was set up as a repository for technologies which can be diffused through the private sector to least developed countries  It also works through other organizations he noted including the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs to generate satellite technology for information on climate change and food security The Committee reconvened at 3 pm for its third panel discussion under the theme Structural transformation as a driver of prosperity Panel 3 In the afternoon the Preparatory Committee held a panel discussion on the theme Structural transformation as a driver of prosperity Chaired by Taye Atske Selassie Amde Ethiopia it featured two keynote speakers  Faruk Kaymakci Deputy Foreign Minister and Director for European Union Affairs of Turkey and Amadou Hott Minister for the Economy Planning and International Cooperation of Senegal  Panelists were Agnes Kalibata Special Envoy of the United Nations SecretaryGeneral to the Food Systems Summit Paul Akiwumi Director Division for Africa Least Developed Countries and Special Programmes of United Nations Conference on Trade and Development UNCTAD and Gauri Pradhan International Coordinator LDC Watch Mr AMDE said that while least developed countries have made efforts to enhance several areas of their economic performance trade and human development during the past decade many have been largely unable to structurally transform their economies to build resilience against internal and external shocks  Challenges that have hindered their progress include difficulties in integrating regional and global value chains limited availability of energy transport and information and communications technology infrastructure limited availability of human capacities insufficient investments challenges in accessing credit and unfavourable legal and regulatory frameworks  Looking ahead new technologies have raised hopes for leapfrogging  To meet the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 countries must assess which sectors contribute most to higher productivity and ultimately create decent jobs and eradicate poverty  Drawing lessons from implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action he said achieving structural transformation will not be possible with a onesizefitsall approach Mr KAYMAKCI in his keynote speech said that over the past decade with support from development partners least developed countries have made significant progress in implementing both the Istanbul Programme of Action and the Sustainable Development Goals  The limited productive capacities are the main cause of the persistent challenges facing least developed countries  Enhancing agricultural productivity is important for reducing poverty as it fosters better food security and higher farm incomes  Tourism is another cornerstone of structural transformation growth and employment in developing economies and has been among the hardest hit of all sectors by COVID19  Therefore it is imperative to support tourism and ensure that the sector regains its position as a provider of decent jobs stable incomes and a guardian of cultural and natural heritage Noting that trade in services creates new economic opportunities and contributes directly to productivity gains he said it is therefore an important channel for helping least developed countries enhance their share in global trade  The international community should continue to support dutyfree and quotafree market access for these countries  Direct investment and concessional loans in addition to ODA have been important instruments for Turkey  Investments by Turkish entrepreneurs particularly in Africa increase every year within the framework of the Cotonou Agenda for productive capacitybuilding in least developed countries  For the last 35 years he said Turkey has supported them through international financial institutions and actively helped them strengthen their science technology and innovation capacities  Turkeys commitment is seen in the establishment of the United Nations Technology Bank on its territory  The success of the new Programme of Action will depend on the efforts made by least developed countries and the international community Ms KALIBATA stressed that agriculture is the backbone of least developed country economies contributing to their food security export earnings and rural development  The most effective way to improve the lives of millions living in poverty is to support agriculture in developing countries  Among the challenges they face are low productivity rigid production and trade structures a limited skills base short life expectancy and low educational qualifications poor infrastructure and inadequate institutional and policy frameworks  Transforming a countrys agriculture sector can create jobs raise incomes reduce malnutrition and kickstart the economy onto a path to middleincome growth  For example least developed countries can export freshcut fruit in retailready packaging rather than bulk fruits  For agricultural and food systems transformative opportunities generally lie in the middle part of agrifood value chains such as in modern packhouse operations and processing facilities  These are where most of the value addition in the food system takes place and they are essential in linking farmers to rewarding markets  In Africa two thirds of all food consumed is handled by the millions of small and mediumsized enterprises  Focusing more attention on this sector can create huge employment opportunities especially for youth  The opportunities for improved food systems are almost limitless he said noting that the United Nations Food Systems Summit represents an opportunity to foster change in the approach to development challenges Mr AKIWUMI said that structural transformation can be understood as the ability of an economy to constantly generate new dynamic activities characterized by higher productivity and increasing returns to scale  Bangladesh  a country that was found eligible for graduation after having met the three criteria  did manage to undertake structural transformation through building productive capacities in the lowtech manufacturing sector  Unfortunately the case of Bangladesh is more of an exception than the rule  One way to achieve it is by supporting the request of least developed countries made within WTO to extend their transition period  The cause of their vulnerability is the limited development of their productive capacities  UNCTAD has identified eight components of productive capacities  natural capital human capital energy information and communications technology transport private sector institutions and structural change  The next Programme of Action must help least developed countries make durable progress towards and beyond graduation a process UNCTAD calls graduation with momentum  Therefore productive capacities should form the overarching framework for the next Programme of Action  All other strategies and related policies should be intertwined within this broad goal rather than appearing as the usual shopping list  UNCTAD has developed a Productive Capacities Index as a policy tool to help Governments gauge the development of their productive capacities he noted stressing that the entity must be considered their key partner including in the negotiation of the text for the Doha Programme Mr PRADHAN said several structural adjustment initiatives introduced in recent decades have failed to deliver promised outcomes  Conventional structural transformation has not driven growth in part because there is a disconnect between material gains and human assets  Many international conventions and agreed mechanisms on least developed countries remain weak in terms of their impact on local communities  Donors meanwhile have not fulfilled their commitments to help improve infrastructure in the poorest countries he said  In turn Governments have failed to control everincreasing corruption disparity and instability  Unsustainable debt has also generated unequal access to intellectual property rights  He called on the international community to ensure access to affordable reliable sustainable energy to direct all kinds of technical assistance towards essential specific infrastructure and to consider information and communications technology as an indispensable driver for infrastructure  It also must assist least developed countries with climate adaptation and mitigation recognize the crisis caused by COVID19 and address the existing resource constraints  The next Programme of Action cannot be a continuation of the past failed experiences he emphasized In the ensuing discussion the representative of  Malawi  speaking for the Least Developed Countries Group said structural transformation is a stumbling block to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals  Many least developed countries depend on commodity production and exports making them vulnerable to price fluctuations he said underscoring the importance of economic diversification  Partnerships and collaboration are needed to ensure capacitybuilding for least developed countries he said commending UNCTAD on the creation of its Productive Capacity Index The representative of  Bangladesh  highlighted the need for the right mix of policy options for structural transformation  Our inability to do so right now may lead to a situation wherein the current decade may be dubbed as a decade of lost development he warned  However some least developed countries including his own have started to move away from this vicious cycle  As people expanded from agriculture into industry and service sectors value additions increased in all sectors  He asked panellists about innovative initiatives that can be undertaken to foster resilient infrastructure and about how small and mediumsized enterprises can better integrate into global value and supply chains The representative of the  Private Sector Development  said the next Programme of Action must incentivize small and mediumsized enterprises  Regulatory frameworks and access to finance could be either barriers or enablers  The perception of responsible investment needs to change as investors avoid investing in least developed countries  Reputational risk can be turned into reputational opportunity  The United Nations Principles of Responsible Investments must be revised to encourage a certain level of investment in least developed countries  In addition to ODA he called for a new financing mechanism to support impact investments Mr AKIWUMI pointed out that when building infrastructure it is important to consider the connectivity of production and markets  To develop ecommerce countries also need a stable power supply and steady Internet connectivity  On access to financing he said it is extremely difficult for local firms to compete in regional markets if they are borrowing at an interest rate of 19 per cent  Least developed countries can export their commodities to their neighbours  In Kenya Swiss chocolate is cheaper than Egyptian chocolate  Africa should focus on concluding a continental free trade agreement  By curbing illicit financial flows lowincome countries can generate domestic financing  The biggest obstacle to developing fisheries in Africa is obtaining public health certification in order to be accepted in the European market Summing up the discussion Mr AMDE said the issue of structural transformation can be addressed before the Doha conference  The Istanbul Programme charted out a vision and aspiration for least developed countries  The Doha Programme must give more vitality to the development of least developed countries
