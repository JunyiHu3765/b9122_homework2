Semiconductors MEPs adopt legislation to boost EU chips industry EU Chips Act will strengthen Europes strategic autonomy and security Crisis response mechanism to deal with shortages 33 billion for research and innovation related to chips The new law already agreed upon between Parliament and Council aims to create a favourable environment for chip investments in Europe by fast tracking permitting procedures and recognising their critical importance via a socalled highest national significance statute Small and mediumsized businesses will also benefit from increased support especially in the area of chip design in order to boost innovation The legislation will support projects that boost the EUs security of supply by attracting investment and building up production capacity During the talks with the representatives of the Council MEPs secured 33 billion for research and innovation related to chips A network of competence centres will be created to address the EUs skills shortage and attract new talent for research design and production A crisis response mechanism will be set up through which the Commission will assess the risks to the EUs supply of semiconductors Early warning indicators in member states will be used to trigger an EUwide shortage alert This mechanism will allow the Commission to implement emergency measures such as prioritising the supply of products particularly affected by a shortage or carrying out common purchasing for member states MEPs further improved the scheme by introducing a mapping tool that will help identify possible supply bottlenecks These measures will be a last resort in the event of a crisis in the semiconductors sector Parliament also backed provisions to strengthen international cooperation with strategic partners and on intellectual property rights to guarantee competitive advantages and protection for the EU sector Rapporteur   SD RO said With the European Chips Act we aim to strengthen the EUs position in the global semiconductor landscape and to address the vulnerabilities in supply chains exposed by the pandemic We want to have more influence and to be leaders so we have secured 33 billion for research and innovation We aim to boost technological capacity and are implementing measures to combat potential shortages Europe is prepared to face the future challenges in the semiconductor industry prioritising strategic autonomy security and a favourable business environment The legislation was adopted with 587 votes to 10 with 38 abstentions It will now have to be endorsed by the Council of ministers in order to become law  highlights that Europes share in global production capacity of semiconductors is below 10 The legislative proposal aims to bring it up to 20 Another piece of Parliament   from 2022 highlighted that the pandemic has revealed longstanding vulnerabilities in global supply chains and the unprecedented shortage of semiconductors is a prime example It shows what might be in store in the years to come These shortages have led among other issues to rising costs for industry and higher prices for consumers and have been slowing down the pace of recovery in Europe With the European Chips Act MEPs respond to   This Act addresses proposal 115 by promoting the expansion of European technology as a robust alternative to foreign counterparts It also responds to the need for supply security and manufacturing enhancement in Europe as outlined in proposal 1212 The Act echoes the sentiments of proposal 173 and 177 advocating for strengthened EU supply chains through strategic investments and enhanced intermember state cooperation to manage supply chain risks With over 43 billion of public and private investments mobilised the Act sets forth measures to proactively manage and swiftly respond to future supply chain disruptions
